<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>I sent my website to my sister, my mother, and my sisters husband. The common problem they pointed out was the navigations weren't working. I checked my code and changed it to make sure they can use it correctly. They also pointed out I need to make the information more organized. Here is the revised dragon project</p>
<ul><li> <a href="dragon.2/index.html">Dragon Revised</a></li></ul>
<p>I learned a lot of html css and a little java script this semester. I struggled a lot with css it was very confusing at first. Html was the easiest to work on for me. Working on this project made me think of how much hard work it takes to make a succesful website. Plus I learned about the Dragon 2.I now know how to make a website and am familiar with coding. I think this is a good start for me and I really enjoyed it. If I were to do it over again I would pay more attention. The online class does not motivate me because I have to watch and it's not very interactive. I think I would learn better if this class was available in person.</p>
<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p> Progressive Enhancement is using a programming language, page structure, and style information to make a website. HTML is what makes the website, CSS styles the html, and JavaScript implements features to the website. This is important because everyone has different devices and the way progressive enhancement is it helps users have the same functionality on their website.</p>
